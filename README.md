Objective:
My task is like building the UI for an E-commerce Listing Page based
on the provided Figma design. The page should display a list of products, and
each product should have an option to either view the product or add it to the
cart. There will be no dedicated product page, so when a user clicks "View
Product," they should be redirected to a custom Thank You page.
Additionally, when users click "Add to Cart," a modal should open, as per ui
design.
